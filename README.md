# Wonders of the 5% We've Seen
Humans have explored 5% of Earth's Oceans, what have we found so far?

### Project Description
This website will let the user submerge a submarine into the ocean manually, then control the submarine using scrolling. The submarine will then follow the user as they scroll down. Occasionally, photos accompanied by infographics in the form of comics will pop up about deep sea creatures like the elbow squid, telescope fish, etc. As the user scrolls down, there will be fish swimming in the background.
This project is a group assignment for Professor Nimrah Syed's Fall 2023 communications lab class. I did this project alone because I was bedridden with influenza and then pneumonia for two weeks and missed a lot of class and was rendered unable to work. That was not fun.

### Process & Reflection
I started by plotting out the general concept of the project on Notion. I wanted a light-hearted and educational tone to the website. I've got a lot of random knowledge about biology and one of my favorite topics to talk about is the deep sea and all their weird things that are down there. I made the comic strips using a combination of Canva and Adobe Photoshop. As per usual, I tested my index.html on FireFox browser to more easily identify bugs and more specifically adjust CSS values. When I hit a brick wall I would search up YouTube tutorials on how to do certain things. If that didn't work I would use GPT4 to help me debug and plan out my code.
I've learned quite a bit about JavaScript in regard to CSS during the making of this project. I would've liked to add a feature to enlarge the comic but I didn't quite know how to do that. I also wish I knew how to use animations other than fading in and fading out. In addition to that, the length of the website was also something I wish I could've improved. The website felt too short but I didn't want to break anything so I took it as a compromise. Personally I'm quite proud of how to the colors and sprites look together. I also think my comics are pretty well-written for multiple 3-panel comics using only among us sprites. Cheesy, but like a good Swiss cheese.
